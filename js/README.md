# A Simple Password Generator and Manager in JavaScript

## It generates a random string of characters, allows the user to decide the password length and store and retrieve the site name and password persistently from local storage in Object Oriented Javascript

## This project demonstrates a basic understanding of the following concepts:

* Object Oriented Javascript
* Working with local storage
* Functional programming 
* Working with asynchronous code and with APIs such as the navigator.clipboard

## Follow the link below and try it out

## Known issues 

* There's a bug in how it stores to local storage. Every so often the data in local storage is erased. I'm still looking into that.
* I could have made it responsive - perhaps mobile-first
* I could have made it a full crud application
* I could have made it more modularized instead of letting procedural code run a bit too long every now and then. 
* I could have displayed site/service/client (names of the sites for which I have saved passwords) names on DOMContentLoaded.
